Concepts:

tSNE
gLoVe


scikit-learn:

1) Feature Unions and Pipelines
2) Estimator chaining
3) GridSearch 


Feature engineering ideas:

1) Normalization and Scaling (Z-Score?) of numeric values
2) TF-IDF
3) SVD
4) Word2Vec features - skew, kurtosis, various distance measures


Code improvements:

1) Time training steps for each model
2) Parallelize - dask? Spark?
3) Pickle train, test dataframes after feature engineering
